@CMUTANT POWERS@H


Mutant powers are somewhat weird abilities.  They are sensitive
to your psionic aura which may be augmented or disrupted by
some items you can wear.

Every skill power invested in mutant power increases chance
to use it by five percent points in addition to other effects
gaining a skill in it might give.


@FIllumination@H: Permanently lights up some area around you.
  For every three skill points invested radius increases.

@FDigestion@H: You can eat and digest virtually anything without
  incurring any side effects bad or good.  This power comes
  with super flexibility to eat items that you have equipped
  but consuming worn eyewear, worn helmets and installed
  cranial bionic implants is going to be impossible until they
  are removed.  Mainly useful to get rid of some buggy stuff.

@FHypnosis@H: With a gaze in the eye you can make others fall
  fast asleep.

@FRegeneration@H: You can focus your body to quickly mend wounds.

@FOptic Blast@H: Emit a blast from eyes at distant target.  Skill
  increases damage.

@FHaste@H: While maintained you speed up considerably.  Skill points
  give two additional points of speed.  Only first ten points
  will grant bonus speed up.

@FTelepathy@H: Allows you to hear other's thoughts and know of their
  presence before actually meeting them.

@FTremorsense@H: You can feel the disturbances caused by steps far
  away and sense threat early.

@FShoot Webs@H: Entangle your enemies in sticky webs.

@FMental Blast@H: Directly assault a mind.  Skill amplifies damage.

@FRestoration@H: Repair long term damage of body.

@FAdrenaline Control@H: Adjust adrenaline levels in your body to
  become stronger.  Grants four points of strength in exchange
  for four points of psionics.

@FX-Ray Vision@H: Your sight can penetrate nearby walls.  Skill does
  not increase sight range.

@FThe Voice@H: Command others to obey you.

@FTeleport@H: Fold space to transport yourself far away.

@FAutolysis@H: Supply psionic energy directly from your body's cells.

@FPsionic Storm@H: Unleash massive psychic attack. This power is
  costly.
