@CRACE AND PROFESSION@H


@CHumans@H:

@FAstronaut@H: TO-DO

@FDetective@H: TO-DO

@FNinja@H: TO-DO

@FPsion@H: You're a scrawny freak.  A freak with strange mutant powers.
  Momma always said not to drink radioactive waste, but you didn't
  listen and now your DNA is supercharged. 

@FQuarterback@H: Back on Earth, you thrill crowds with your athletic skill
  and you have a cheerleader girlfriend.  But in space, you can be
  savior of the universe!

@FSoftware Engineer@H: Your Mountain Dew gut and carpal tunnel syndrome
  put you at a physical disadvantage but at least you remembered to
  bring your laptop computer along.  And your innate ability to notice
  buggy equipment sure is handy.

@FSpace Marine@H: You're one of the tough hombres that defends our planet
  against aliens every night and day.  Your equipment is state of the
  badass art, and you've got a badass attitude to match it.


@COrcs@H:

@FJanitor@H: You're used to being ignored by those with more glamorous job
  titles, but it's you who keeps the galaxy turning, unclogging its
  billions and billions of toilets.  You begin your quest with two
  indispensable tools: a master keycard and monkey wrench.  Being an
  orc allows you to use buggy equipment with ease.  Unfortunately it
  only works for things you equip manually like armor and weapons.


@CReticulans@H:
  They come from a nearby galaxy.  All reticulans are telepaths.

@FAbductor@H: You have a penchant for driving your saucer to planets
  inhabited by unwary non-spacefaring races.  And then raeping them.

@FDissident@H: You are one of the more corrupted member of your species.
  Although not sexually deviant, you play urban poker with star
  systems, and turn planets into giant computers.

@FMastermind@H: You are even more evil than the previous two. You
  masquerade as benevolent space brothers - to your own species
  and others.  Why? Because of the inmense financial benefits you
  can reap from them.


@CYautja@H:

@FHunter@H: At last chance to prove yourself!  After long and very
  difficult training you are finally an adult and about to decorate
  yourself with some freshly killed trophies.  You are equipped with
  some superior Yautja technology.

@COther@H:

@FXel'Naga@H: Designing specimens was your daily job but you grew bored
  and decided to explore the galaxy somewhat.  Your ship was caught
  in a space-time anomaly.  Here you are, stranded on a lone asteroid
  with nothing to help you.  Not even a piece of information.


Some professions are just plain more difficult than others.  Probably
the best roles for beginners are the Space Marine, the Yautja Hunter,
the Ninja, the Janitor and the Software Engineer.  Xel'Naga are blind
and ridiculously difficult.
